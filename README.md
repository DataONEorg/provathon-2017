Provenance information enables datasets that are linked 
to the software and analysis code that created them and used them in research.
It allows users to trace new and ongoing uses of data, and provides rich information about 
the origins of data that ultimaltely supports reproducible research workflows. 
*Prov-a-thon* is a two-day workshop designed to advance practical approaches to
incorporating provenance information into tools and workflows that are useful in 
earth, environmental, and archeological research domains.

- Dates: Aug 31 &  Sept 1, 2017
- Venue: Tamaya Resort, New Mexico
- Sponsors
    - [DataONE](https://dataone.org)
    - [Whole Tale](https://wholetale.org)
    - [Arctic Data Center](https://arcticdata.io)
    - Community Dynamics Project
    

## Goals:
- Learn about Whole Tale/DataONE/other provenance tools and reproducibility
- Add provenance data for rich datasets into DataONE
- Build interest amongst data creators/submitters about adding provenance data
- Organize efforts about reproducibility training and evangelization in archaeology and environmental science
- Stimulate coordination of the development/use of provenance and reproducibility tools
